Project Name: Personal Portfolio – Vikram Singh

Overview:

This project is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase web development, UI/UX, Python, data, and automation projects in a clean and professional way. It focuses on clear information architecture, fast performance, and a smooth user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

Tech Stack & Tools:

	•	HTML5 & semantic structure for accessible content organization.
	•	CSS3 with a custom design system for colors, typography, spacing, and reusable utility classes.
	•	Bootstrap for responsive grid layout, components (navbar, cards, buttons), and consistent spacing across breakpoints.
	•	JavaScript for interactive behavior such as navigation toggles, scroll effects, animations, portfolio filters, and counters.
	•	Formspree integration to handle contact form submissions without needing a custom backend, including validation and success/error states.
	•	Vendor libraries for enhanced UX (icons, scroll animations, lightbox gallery, sliders, and counters where used).
	•	Git & GitHub for version control, change history, and collaboration.
	•	VS Code as the main development environment.


Key Features:

	•	Hero, About, Skills, Resume, Portfolio, Services, Testimonials, Contact, and additional Explore sub‑pages (Skills & Tools, Certificates & Achievements, Blog & Case Studies, Social Profile).
	•	Fully responsive layout optimized for different screen sizes using Bootstrap’s grid and custom media queries.
	•	Reusable components for cards, lists, and sections to keep the codebase consistent and easy to maintain.
	•	Portfolio section with project thumbnails and detail pages describing real projects, tech stacks, and responsibilities.
	•	Contact section powered by Formspree so messages can be sent directly from the website without server‑side code.


Goals of the Project:

	•	Present skills and experience in a structured, recruiter‑friendly format.
	•	Practice full front‑end workflow: planning, design, implementation, refactoring, and deployment.
	•	Serve as a base template that can be extended with new projects, blog posts, and experiments over time.
